## Ticket Goal #2
User the Career Arrows made by Webelo 2's in Goal #1 in their Blue & Gold Banquet.
### S (Specific)
Troop 55, the "parent" or "partner" Troop to Pack 55 takes care of the Bridging Ceremony for new Scouts briding into the Troop at the Blue & Gold Banquets.  
As they have an existing ceremony, we want to integrate the Career Arrows into the Ceremony.  
The Scouts will have the opportunity to share what their Career Arrows are, and what they represent.
### M (Measureable)
Goal will be complete when one (1) Webelos 2/AOL den to complete this Bridging Ceremony.
### A (Attainable)
I will work with the Scoutmaster and Senior Patrol Leader of the Troop to recognize the Scouts by presenting their Career Arrows to them during the ceremony.  
I will describe the purpose and history behind the Career Arrow, and allow the Scouts to display their Arrows to the Scouts, Family, and Friends present.  
I will also open up for the gathered group to ask any questions about the arrows to myself and to the scouts.
### R (Relevant)
My Cub Scout Pack did something similar to this when I bridged to Scouts BSA, and I still have my arrow today.  It hung in my room for many years.  
I want the Scouts to have the same kinds of lasting memories from their AOL ceremony as I still do.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Reach out to Scoutmaster and/or Senior Patrol Leader within 3 months.  
1. Ensure Arrows are complete before Blue & Gold Banquet.

## Ticket Goal #3
Gather information about BALOO training and present to Pack Committee and to all Den Leaders.
### S (Specific)
Educate pack leaders and adults on the value and benefits of having more BALOO training leaders.  This facilities more Pack outdoor and overnight activity options, and lessens the strain on the small number of existing BALOO trained leaders, who will be not be in the Pack forever.
### M (Measureable)
Goal will be complete when information on BALOO is presented at 1 Pack meetings and 1 Pack Committee Meeting.
### A (Attainable)
Information on BALOO is already available at the district and council level.  A cohesive presentation and handout can be created which enhances the minimal effort put on recruiting today.
Gather existing information available.  Gather dates and materials (if available) for next BALOO training.  Assembly a BALOO FAQ as a handout.
### R (Relevant)
One of our current BALOO trained leaders will be leaving the Pack in 16 months.  Our Pack does a minimum of 1 outdoor/overnight activities per Scout Year, and I want to see this number continue or increase.  Camping and being outdoors is at the heart of what I want my Scouts to experience and benefit from.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Research available information within 2 months.  
1. Create First Draft of presentation and handouts within 6 months.  
1. First presentation complete within 9 months.  Goal complete within 16 months.

- Does this Goal show line of sight to the Youth?  Yes

### Progress Update
- Created first draft of basic presentation. [BALOO Presentation](BALOO/BALOO.pptx)
    - Its kinda boring.  Not a lot of "wow" factor.
- Debating if instead of a presentation this should just be a single flyer?
    - That might actually make more sense.
    - Thinking FAQ handout might be more appropriate
        - Does District or Council already have something like this?  
        Reached out to Council via email on 9 April 2024.

## Ticket Goal #4
~~To create a reusable graphical Den and Pack Calendar Template.~~
### S (Specific)
~~Our Pack and Den would benefit from a calendar which can be continually updated and distributed, allowing an overview of the entire year at a glance.  Graphically the information is much easier to understand and digest than in textual/email format.~~
### M (Measureable)
~~The Calendar template will be designed for a full Scout year (July to June).  It will be color coded for Pack and Den Level meetings and events.  It will be completed when the Pack Calendar is filled out, at least 1 Den Calendar is filled out, and it is accessible to the entire Pack either electronically or in paper form.~~
### A (Attainable)
~~Templates are available online, as well as examples provided by other Scout leaders.  Electronic availability, while ideal, presents both a challenge and an opportunity to make the information available and accessible, while limiting access that might otherwise cause data integrity issues.~~
### R (Relevant)
~~Successful planning is the key to every successful pack or troop.  My own planning skills have lacked during my career but have turned around to great success of late.  However, I am lacking a good way to provide an overview to the time commitments for my scouts.~~
### T (Timely)
~~Proposed Goal Schedule:~~
~~1. Gather and review templates and implementation examples within 2 months.~~
~~1. Implement proposed calendar format within 3 months.~~
~~1. Submit for feedback with Pack leaders and Adults within 4 months.~~
~~1. Rollout Pack Calendar and Den 2 (Webelos 1) calendar within 5 months.~~

~~Our troop has an established record of renting the Allsop Center for a winter campout.  Indian Creek Nature Center offers snowshoe rentals and has plentiful trails.~~
