I will also open up for the gathered group to ask any questions about the arrows to myself and to the scouts.
### R (Relevant)
My Cub Scout Pack did something similar to this when I bridged to Scouts BSA, and I still have my arrow today.  It hung in my room for many years.

## Ticket Goal #3
Gather information about BALOO training and present to Pack Committee and to all Den Leaders.
### S (Specific)
Educate pack leaders and adults on the value and benefits of having more BALOO training leaders.  This facilities more Pack outdoor and overnight activity options, and lessens the strain on the small number of existing BALOO trained leaders, who will be not be in the Pack forever.

### R (Relevant)
One of our current BALOO trained leaders will be leaving the Pack in 16 months.  Our Pack does a minimum of 1 outdoor/overnight activities per Scout Year, and I want to see this number continue or increase.  Camping and being outdoors is at the heart of what I want my Scouts to experience and benefit from.

### Progress Update
- Created first draft of basic presentation. [BALOO Presentation](BALOO/BALOO.pptx)
    - Its kinda boring.  Not a lot of "wow" factor.
- Debating if instead of a presentation this should just be a single flyer?
    - That might actually make more sense.
    - Thinking FAQ handout might be more appropriate
        - Does District or Council already have something like this?  
        Reached out to Council via email on 9 April 2024.
