## Goal #1
### Ticket Goal

Target is for Scouts completing AOL at Blue and Gold Banquet 2024
### A (Attainable)
Will work with Subject Matter Experts at our charter organization, the Waltonian Archers of Linn County, for assistance with arrow construction.  Will decorate and seal arrows as a den during meetings prior to arrow assembly.
### R (Relevant)
This project will provide the Scouts with a tangible reminder of their time in the Pack.  It will also be unique to our Pack, and will provide and incentive for younger scouts to stay in Cub Scouts, and entice other potential members to join the Pack.

## Goal #2
### Ticket Goal
Implement a modified Arrow of Light Bridging Ceremony which uses the Carrer Arrows from Goal 1.
### S (Specific)
Modify the AOL Bridging ceremony such that the Career Arrows are Fired into a target.  After the Scouts have bridged into Scouts BSA they will retrieve their Arrow from the target, completing their Arrow of Light Journey.
### M (Measureable)
Goal will be complete when one (1) Webelos 2/AOL den to complete this Bridging Ceremony.
### A (Attainable)
I will work with the Cub Master and Pack Committee to get the concept approved.  I will work with the Cub Master and the Charter Organization to identify a suitable and safe location to conduct the ceremony.  I will work with the Cub Master and Charter Organization to ensure the safety of the Scouts, their families, and all in attendance.
### R (Relevant)
My Cub Scout Pack did this when I bridged to Scouts BSA, and I still have my arrow today.  It hung in my room for many years.  I want the Scouts to have the same kinds of lasting memories from their AOL ceremony as I still do.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Reach out to Cub Master and Pack Committee within 1 month.  
1. Reach out to Charter Org within 3 months.

## Goal #3
### Ticket Goal
To create an information package and presentation to educate Pack adults and leaders on BALOO training.
### S (Specific)
Educate pack leaders and adults on the value and benefits of having more BALOO training leaders.  This facilities more Pack outdoor and overnight activity options, and lessens the stain on the small number of existing BALOO trained leaders, who will be transitioning out of the Pack in 16 months.
### M (Measureable)
Goal will be complete when information on BALOO is presented at 3 Pack meetings and 5 Den Meetings (1 for each Cub Scout Rank Den).
### A (Attainable)
Information on BALOO is already available at the district and council level.  A cohesive presentation and handout can be created which enhances the minimal effort put on recruiting today.
### R (Relevant)
Our current BALOO trained leaders will be leaving the Pack in 16 months.  Our Pack does a minimum of 2 outdoor/overnight activities per Scout Year, and I want to see this number continue or increase.  Camping and being outdoors is at the heart of what I want my Scouts to experience and benefit from.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Research available information within 2 months.  
1. Create First Draft of presentation and handouts within 6 months.  
1. First presentation complete within 9 months.  Goal complete within 16 months.

## Goal #4
### Ticket Goal
To create a reusable graphical Den and Pack Calendar Template.
### S (Specific)
Our Pack and Den would benefit from a calendar which can be continually updated and distributed, allowing an overview of the entire year at a glance.  Graphically the information is much easier to understand and digest than in textual/email format.
### M (Measureable)
The Calendar template will be designed for a full Scout year (July to June).  It will be color coded for Pack and Den Level meetings and events.  It will be completed when the Pack Calendar is filled out, at least 1 Den Calendar is filled out, and it is accessible to the entire Pack either electronically or in paper form.
### A (Attainable)
Templates are available online, as well as examples provided by other Scout leaders.  Electronic availability, while ideal, presents both a challenge and an opportunity to make the information available and accessible, while limiting access that might otherwise cause data integrity issues.
### R (Relevant)
Successful planning is the key to every successful pack or troop.  My own planning skills have lacked during my career but have turned around to great success of late.  However, I am lacking a good way to provide an overview to the time commitments for my scouts.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Gather and review templates and implementation examples within 2 months.  
1. Implement proposed calendar format within 3 months.  
1. Submit for feedback with Pack leaders and Adults within 4 months.  
1. Rollout Pack Calendar and Den 2 (Webelos 1) calendar within 5 months.

Goal is to hold one (1) Winter Overnight campout (indoors) and one (1) winter outdoor activity for our Pack.
### M (Measureable)
Hold one (1) Winter Overnight campout (indoors) and one (1) winter outdoor activity for our Pack.
### A (Attainable)
Our troop has an established record of renting the Allsop Center for a winter campout.  Indian Creek Nature Center offers snowshoe rentals and has plentiful trails.
### R (Relevant)
Our Pack does more outdoor activities during the Fall, Spring, and Summer.  Providing more opportunities in Winter helps foster willingness and enjoyment for those opportunities later in life.
### T (Timely)
Proposed Goal Schedule:  
1. Schedule Pack overnight opportunity at Allsop Center for January 2024.  
1. Investigate Winter Activity options at Indian Creek Nature Center and Wikiup Hill within 6 months.
