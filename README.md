Wood Badge 4-172-23 for Kent Wedeking

Welcome to my Wood Badge ticket.  
I'm a software engineer.  As such I was looking for a way to document my Wood Badge that was
- Easily accessible
- Maintains a robust revision history
- Can be edited from almost anywhere

Also I'm a really big fan of Markdown files and how the visualize.  I've chosen to convert my ticket into a Markdown file. 
This will chronicle my adventures in Ticketing.  

Now, on to Gilwell.
